    "2) Create a static method to check whether a given day (indexed between 0 and 6) is an even number or odd number. The method is called is_even_day and should return True if it is even day, otherwise False. (2p)\n",

    "5) has functionality to count the number of employees. Note that this cannot be done through `self`, but using a class variable. (1p)\n",

    "6) Add a `classmethod` to raise pay by amount (the method inputs the amount as an argument). (2p)\n",

Also, put the option to select items in a list with their prices like a dictionary. Put in an error check such that price is always positive and your code throws an error if user calls the method with a negative price. It should add the price to the price_list and add the price value to __balance__ attribute and the item name to the list attribute __cart__ . Finally it should return the new __cart__ attribute. \n",
    "   - __check_balance__ which returns a print statement as follows: \"Your current balance is {self.balance} Eur\"\n",
    "   - __remove_item__ which takes the attributes: _item_ indicating item(default value: None). It should subtract the price of the selected item from the __balance__ attribute and delete the item name from the list attribute __cart__ along with its price from the price list. Again put the option so that user can remove several items in a list. Put in an error check such that the name belongs to the list of items in cart and your code throws an error if user wants to remove an item which does not exist in the cart. Finally it should return the new __cart__ attribute."
