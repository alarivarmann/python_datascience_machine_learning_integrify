# 01. What is Python and why you should learn it?

Python is a mature language which was first released in 1991 which means it turns 30 during the next years. Not bad for a programming language these days, right?

As stated in python.org:

> Python is powerful... and fast;
plays well with others;
runs everywhere;
is friendly & easy to learn;
is Open.

Python syntax is easy to read yet it's still powerful for most use cases, it's standard library is large and the ever growing online community has a package for pretty much every problem we're going to face. Due to these facts it has become de facto tool for data-analysis and machine learning (together with R) during the past years.

If you're a newcomer these few modules on Python basics will help you on the future modules which focus on tools made with Python. And if you're a seasoned pro it's still good to recall some of the basic stuff.
