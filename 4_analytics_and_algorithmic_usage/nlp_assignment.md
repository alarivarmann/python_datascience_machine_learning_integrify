# Assignments on Natural Language Processing

These assignments are meant to give you some intuition for how the Pandas inbuilt commands operating on strings might actually be working.

## Task 1 : Give  use cases of the following commands, using a text generated by yourself:

- nltk.tokenize.sent_tokenize
- nltk.tokenize.word_tokenize
- nltk.probability.FreqDist
- nltk.corpus.stopwords
- nltk.stem.PorterStemmer
- nltk.stem.wordnet.WordNetLemmatizer
- nltk.tokenize.RegexpTokenizer
- sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer
- sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer


## Task 2
Write a Python program that matches a word at the beginning of a string.
Make this into a runnable script. Refer to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4042905/what-is-main-py)



## Task 3

Write a Python program that matches a word at end of string, with optional punctuation.
Make this into a runnable script. Refer to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4042905/what-is-main-py)


## Task 4 : Date Extraction
Write a Python program to extract year, month and day from an url.
Make this into a runnable script. Refer to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4042905/what-is-main-py)



## Task 5:  Write a Python program to convert a date of yyyy-mm-dd format to dd-mm-yyyy format.
Make this into a runnable script. Refer to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4042905/what-is-main-py)
