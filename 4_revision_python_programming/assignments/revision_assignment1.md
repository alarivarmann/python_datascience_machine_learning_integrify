# DATA SCIENCE Revision Assignment : Closer to Real Life Data

Replicate all the data science commands in the Revision Notebook on real datasets
[link](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch), you may also use other datasets that you like, but no randomly generated ones.

Step 1 : Find a suitable dataset(s) to analyze (e.g. for time series find some time series data)
Step 2 : Recplicate  the following commands on the chosen dataset(s)

- Creating Dataframe from columns
- Creating Dataframe from compressed or CSV file
- Cross table
- Pivot Table
- MAP on Series
- PLOTS : Scatter, pairplot, histogram, barplot -- stacked vs not, boxplot
- Descriptive statistics : Mean, Median, Kurtosis, Skewness
- Functional programming : map, reduce, filter, lambda
- Time Series plots on cumulative values
- Resample command used to change the frequency of the timeseries
- Writing a decorator to implement some of the beforementioned functionality

# FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING and RECURSIVE FUNCTIONS

## Task 1 : Lowest Common Multiple
Return lowest common multiple of a list of floats and integers.
In case other arguments are provided, return "Undefined"

## Task 2 : Reversion
Write a function that given a function operating on a -dimensional  list, first reverses that n-dimensional list.


# OOP, ARGS, KWARGS, DECORATORS

## Task 3 : Write OOP Class for decorator
Write a class that takes a function as input argument and proves that that class acts as a decorator (meaning that the user should be able to see that the function was executed within the decorator)
