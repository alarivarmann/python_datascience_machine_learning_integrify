# FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING and RECURSIVE FUNCTIONS
## Task 1 : Lowest Common Multiple
Return lowest common multiple of a list of floats and integers.
In case other arguments are provided, return "Undefined"

## Task 2 : Reversion
Write a function that given a function operating on a -dimensional  list, first reverses that n-dimensional list.


# OOP, ARGS, KWARGS, DECORATORS

## Task 3 : Write OOP Class for decorator
Write a class that takes a function as input argument and proves that that class acts as a decorator (meaning that the user should be able to see that the function was executed within the decorator)


## Task 4 : NamedTuple
* Create a class `MedicalRecord` without init method.
* Created `namedtuple` called `PersonalDetails` with a fieldname `date_of_birth`.
* Create a new object `patient_1_details` that is a subclass of Personaldetails, with `date_of_birth` equal to '09-04-1991'.
* Create a namedtuple called `Patient_features` with two fieldnames -- `eye_color` and `blood_pressure`.
* Create an object patient_1_features with green eyes and blood pressure of 90.

* Question 1 : Can you print out the namespaces of both  `patient_1_details` and `PersonalDetails` ? Why/why not?
* Task : Add a static method `merge` that is able to concatenate any amount of named tuples. Essentialy it has to return (namedtuple) containing details from all records, in entry order

Example of behaviour:

`print(MedicalRecord.merge(patient_1_details, patient_1_features)) has to result in`
`PersonalDetails_Patient_features(date_of_birth='09-04-1991', eye_color='Green', blood_pressure=90)`


## Task 5 : Give  use cases of the following commands, using a text generated by yourself:

- nltk.tokenize.sent_tokenize
- nltk.tokenize.word_tokenize
- nltk.probability.FreqDist
- nltk.corpus.stopwords
- nltk.stem.PorterStemmer
- nltk.stem.wordnet.WordNetLemmatizer
- nltk.tokenize.RegexpTokenizer
- sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer
- sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB
- sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer
- sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB
