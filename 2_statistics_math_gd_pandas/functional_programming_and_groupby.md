## Task 1 (2p)

Write functional programming code to apply a list of functions on a list of integers. Explain how it works as well and how it relates to functional programing.

## Task 2 (4 p)

Find the greatest common divisor of a list of numbers using Reduce. Explain how the code works as well. Explain how it works as well and how it relates to functional programing.


## Task 3 (6p)

1. Write a function groupby_demonstrator that takes as a list of tuples as an input (arg data) as well as boolean argument (verify_sorted). If verify_sorted is true, the list is sorted by the first key (0-th tuple element), otherwise it is not sorted.

The function should print out key-value pairs by groups (as output from Python groupby). The print statements between groups should have an empty line. Print statements inside-group should not have empty lines in between (just new lines between records).

2. Add a decorator ‘ensure_sourted_grouper’ that overrides the grouping, by making sure that the list is sorted when an argument ‘verify_sorted’ = True is passed. Otherwise, “You didn’t enforce the order” is printed to the console.

## Task 4 (5p)

In your own words, describe what is functional programming and how you can write functional programming code in Python (start here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functional.html)
